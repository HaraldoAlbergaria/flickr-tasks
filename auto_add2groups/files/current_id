# Here is the id of the current photo being processed.

# If this file is not provided or the id is invalid, the script will create a new one
# with the id of the last (newest) photo in the photoset. In this case, the script will
# run over the photos added from that point. To start the script on any photo in the
# photoset, set a valid id here. The photos will then be processed in increasing order
# of upload time.
