# Here is the id of the last photo added by the script.

# If this file is not provided or the id is invalid, the script will create a new one
# with the id of the last (newest) photo in the photostream. In this case, the script will
# run over just the photos added after it. To start the script on any photo in the
# photostream, set here a valid photo id. The photos will then be processed in increasing
# order of upload time, starting from the next photo to the id that was set here.
